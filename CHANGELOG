    to find a new one.

  - The game now searches for data files more effeciently by looking
    in the preset DATADIR, which is based on PREFIX. See the Makefile.

  - Simplified version detection. Value is now stored in top-level
    makefile.

  - Added "ships" directory to Makefile's install section.

  - Updated src/Makefile and Makefile to remove duplicate effort.

  - Added Makefile.windows to ease cross-platform builds. Added
    target "make windows" to top-level make file.

    friendly. 

============ openssn-0.5 released June 26, 2011 ==========

  - Main menu can now select and launch missions.

  - Added new drawing function CircleFill()

  - Game now displays main menu with interactive buttons.

  - We should only need to find data files once, then the files module
    remembers their location.

  - Moved primative drawing functions to draw.h, draw.cpp from
    main.h, main.cpp. This allows us to draw things in other
    modules, like the menu.

  - Created Menu module for displaying and working woth the main menu.

  - Sonar screen now shows angle and direction to target.

  - If the player's sub is destoryed, the game should now end gracefully.

  - Created top-level make file for easier access.

  - Towed sonar array limits sub's maximum speed.

  - Crew now gives feedback about extending/reteiving towed array.

  - Sonar display now adds more colour contrast to different types
    of signals. Surface ships are green, submarines blue and torpedoes
    are red.

  - Torpedoes show up on sonar.

  - Created new mission

  - Missions can now be accessed using the -m flag on the command line.

  - Targeting system now respects the new ship linked list format.

  - Adjusted ship data file format to be more clean.

  - Ships are now stored in a linked list, rather than fixed array.

  - Submarines now run from torpedoes.

  - Ships with sonar will now run away from torpedoes.

  - Fixed torpedo's sonar.

  - Fixed ESM station display. Signals from targets now display.

  - Converted abs() calls to fabs for compatibility with FreeBSD.


============ openssn-0.3 released May 30, 2011 =================

  - Non-player ships now make course changes on their own.

  - Ships now take damage when hit by torpedoes and sink.

  - Torpedoes can now run out of fuel (after around 8-10 miles).

  - Added torpedo clean-up code.

  - Torpedos now listen for and track their targets.

  - Torpedos and noisemakers can now be fired by the player
    and are shown on the tactical map.
    
  - Torpedoes and noisemakers can be loaded using the mouse.

  - Reduced CPU usage on Weapons screen by about 50%.

  - Toned down waterfall display a little, reduced brightness.

  - Added weapons console and the ability to load/unload tubes.

  - Ship class data (name, speed, depth) is now kept in the
    "ships" directory and is loaded at the beginning of each
    scenario.

  - Now we can only select a target if we can see it on the map.


  ============ openssn-0.2 released May 23, 2011 ================

  - Added rough manual in ODF and PDF formats.

  - Sub now turns/dives a little faster.

  - We now display a message when switching screens to show which
    console we are viewing.

  - Desired depth and speed now stay within sane ranges.

  - Player can now get information on selected targets.

  - TMA screen wasn't working, removed it.

  - Targets are now picked up faintly at first, then become solid
    contacts and fade out when the signal is lost.

  - Made sure detection through sonar, esm and radar work.
    Also made sure radar and esm does not track subs.

  - Players can only see ships on the map if they can detect them.

  - Player ships is now green and thicker on the map, making
    it easier to spot.

  - Extended CreateShips function to allow for more missions.
    Missions can be created in data/ships.dat files.

  - Radar and ESM no longer work is we are below periscope depth.

  - Makefile now handles install and deinstall targets

  - Massive code clean-up to allow the game to access data and
    image files in other locations (ie /usr/local/share/games/openssn)

  - Moved data and images files into their own directories.

  - Map now zooms in/out smoothly

  - Reduced CPU usage, was around 95-100%. Should now be closer
