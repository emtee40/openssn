The data directory contains two important sets of files. Both are
required for scenarios and are assigned matching numbers.
The first set of files are the ship files. These tell us what ships
will be involved in a mission.

The format for the ships files goes like this:

Active Type Class Friend Speed Depth Heading Latitude Longitude SonarAngel 

Active should always be "1".
Type determines submarine (0) or ship (1)
Class must match to a class from the "ships" directory.
Friend tells us which side the ship is on. Zero is a FOE, 1 is a Friend,
       2 is unknown and 3 is neutral.
Speed is in knots, heading in degrees, depth is in feet.
The sonar entry tells us the angle of sonar the ship has and this should
be in or aorund the 70-120 range.

The follwing example shows us two ships. The first is a friendly submarine
traveling at 5 knots at 47 feet, due east. The second entry is a surface
ship (merchant class) traveling at 15 knotes south-west.

1 0 1 1 5.0 47 90 150000 150000 75.0 1
1 1 4 3 15.0 0 230 140000 170000 115.0 1



The other kind of file is the mission file. This will assign required
tasks to ships. The mission file must assign missions to ships in the
same order the ships file lists them.

The format for the file is as follows:

Action Timer

Action can be any one of the following:
None - do not assign any special significance to this ship
Sink - to complete the mission, this ship must be sunk
Alive - To complete this mission this ship must remain alive
Find  - We must find and track this target to beat the mission.

The optional Timer variable only applies to ships marked with "Alive".
This tells us how long, in seconds, the ship must survive for the mission
to be a success.  At the end of the file we can append text to tell the
player what their mission is.

For example, we can create a mission file to go with
the above ships file which looks like this:

None
Find
This mission requires you to find a merchant ship. That is all.
