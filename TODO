AI stuff
The AI ships should occasionally turn and/or change speed

Torpedo stuff
Create torpedo code (ShipType 3, ShipClass 5)
  Torpedoes will be ships, but stored in a linked list rather than
  an array due to their constant changes.
  And torps will have severe fuel restrictions.
  (At some point the ships should move to a linked-list too.)
Display torpedos on map
Add noise maker (ShipType 4, ShipClass 6)


Add missions and objectives
Add thermal layer?

Fix ESM signal analysis box.
